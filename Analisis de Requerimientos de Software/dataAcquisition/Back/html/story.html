               <p>The story begins on a tropical island where hybrid musical animals called Bam Banimals live. Suddenly an unfortunate event happened, a virus arrived at the island and affected many Bam Banimals, infecting one half of their appearance causing their tuning to be out of tune. So now they are lost and scattered on the island without intonation.</p>

               <p> Luhzio our main character is the only one who was not influenced by the virus, because it is the only non-hybrid Bam Banimal, so the player as Luhzio will go through several levels at the island that consist of re-singing its friends with the relevant percussion for each one. </p>

                   The player will be able to learn different musical ensembles of percussion instruments, also different tones that they make. This will be possible by showing in the screen certain keys that represent notes that the instrument produces. Meanwhile, the player will learn more notes and basic chords that can be of use outside the game.
                   <br> <br>
                   In an educational way, the objective for the player is to know and identify with musical theory the combinations with each sound that can be formed depending on the skills of each character.
